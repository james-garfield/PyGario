Agar.io implementation writing in Python using Pygame and Pygbag.

## Idea
The idea is that by using Pygame and Pygbag I will see what needs to be improved upon and create a single 
module: PyGario that will handle the game creation and WASM for you. That way you write your game just once and run it
everywhere.
